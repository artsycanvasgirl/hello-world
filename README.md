# hello-world
My first repository
Hello! My name is Kathy. I enjoy learning new things. This is my first time on GitHub. I worked in IT and Finance for 25+ years. Then I took a hiatus and became a full-time artist. It was fun! Now I am back and interested in data analytics. I just finished four courses on Tableau.
